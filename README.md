# SkinSystem
The SkinSystem for make minecraft's server can change their player skin with custom skin.

## Introduction
First! sorry for my bad english. So this project has been developing for minecraft server's owners that turn online-mode to false the cause of this configuration is if player plays minecraft with non-premium account they can't upload any skin like a premium account with this reason the developers of this project try to improve that variation.

This plugin should make it for cracked players more at ease to find there *OWN CUSTOM SKIN* without having to search for it they can upload it to the website and have it applyed instantly.

The plugins works with the API of Skinsrestorer so that MineSkin can change and apply skins instantly . We want to say "Thank you" to all developer of SkinRestorer and MinSkin.
